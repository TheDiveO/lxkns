`lxkns` is a Golang package for discovering Linux kernel namespaces (and mount
points). In every nook and cranny of your Linux hosts. For mount namespaces,
lxkns finds mount points even in process-less mount namespaces (for instance, as
utilized in ["snap" technology](https://snapcraft.io/docs)). Our discovery
engine even determines the visibility of mount points, taking different forms of
"overmounting" into consideration.

- discovery web frontend and containerized backend discovery service (with REST
  API).

- CLI namespace discovery tools.

- features marshalling and unmarshalling namespace discovery results to and from
  JSON ‚Äì which is especially useful to separate the super-privileged scanner
  from non-root frontends: run namespace discoveries as a containerized service.

- helps Go programs with switching namespaces.

- tested with Go 1.13-1.16.

- also supports "time" Linux-kernel namespaces (where available).

## üîé Comprehensive Namespace Discovery

When compared to most well-known and openly available CLI tools, such as
`lsns`, the `lxkns` package detects namespaces even in places of a running
Linux system other tools typically do not consider. In particular:

1. from the procfs filesystem in `/proc/[PID]/ns/*` ‚Äì as `lsns` and other
   tools do.
2. bind-mounted namespaces, via `/proc/[PID]/mountinfo`. Our discovery method
   even finds bind-mounted namespaces in _other_ mount namespaces than the
   current one in which the discovery starts (as long as other mount namespaces have at least one process attached).
3. file descriptor-referenced namespaces, via `/proc/[PID]/fd/*`.
4. intermediate hierarchical user and PID namespaces, via `NS_GET_PARENT`
   ([man 2 ioctl_ns](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ns.2.html)).
5. user namespaces owning non-user namespaces, via `NS_GET_USERNS` ([man 2
   ioctl_ns](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ns.2.html)).

| tool | `/proc/[PID]/ns/*` ‚ë† | bind mounts ‚ë° | `/proc/[PID]/fd/*` ‚ë¢ | hierarchy ‚ë£ | owning user namespaces ‚ë§ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lsns` | ‚úì | | | |
| `lxkns` | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì |

Applications can control the extent to which a `lxkns` discovery tries to
ferret out namespaces from the nooks and crannies of Linux hosts.

> Some discovery methods are more expensive than others, especially the
> discovery of bind-mounted namespaces in other mount namespaces. The reason
> lies in the design of the Go runtime which runs multiple threads and Linux
> not allowing multi-threaded processes to switch mount namespaces. In order
> to work around this constraint, `lxkns` must fork and immediately re-execute
> the process it is used in. Applications that want to use such advanced
> discovery methods thus **must** call `reexec.CheckAction()` as early as
> possible in their `main()` function. For this, you need to `import
> "github.com/thediveo/gons/reexec"`.

## üéõ Cgroup v1, v1+v2, v2 Support

In addition to namespaces and their related processes, lxkns also discovers the
freezer state and (freezer) cgroup controller path information for the processes
attached to namespaces.

> **Important!** When the lxkns service is deployed containerized using the
> included `deployments/lxkns/docker-compose.yaml` it will automatically detect
> system configurations where Docker places the service container in its own
> cgroup namespace. In order to provide full discovery information the lxkns
> service then automatically switches back out of the container's cgroup
> namespace into the initial cgroup namespace. The rationale here is that
> docker-compose unfortunately lacks support for the `--cgroupns=host` CLI flag
> ([issue #8167](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/8167)) and thus
> switching is necessary as a stop-gap measure.

- **cgroups v1**: lxkns automatically detects the v1 freezer hierarchy and its
  location.
- "hybrid" **cgroups v1+v2**: if the v1 freezer hierarchy is mounted, lxkns will
  automatically detect and use it; otherwise, lxkns will use the unified cgroups
  v2 hierarchy instead, with its built-in core freezer (Linux kernel 5.2 and
  later).
- "pure" **cgroups v2**: lxkns will automatically detect and use the unified
  cgroups v2 hierarchy when no v1 freezer hierarchy is present.

To a limited extend, the names of (freezer) control groups often relate to the
partitioning of processes using Linux kernel namespaces. For instance, processes
in Docker containers will show control group names in the form of `docker/<id>`
(or `docker-<id>.scope`, or ...), where the id is the usual 64 hex char string.
Plain containerd container processes will show up with `<namespace>/<id>`
control group names.

## üñ¥ Mount Points

In mount namespaces, lxkns discovers the mount point hierarchy (from `mountinfo`
in procfs) and then derives not only the mount path hierarchy from it, but also
mount point **visibility**. Mount points can become hidden (invisible) when
getting "overmounted":

- in-place overmount: another mount point at the same mount path as a previous
  mount point hides the former mount point. It is even possible to bind-mount a
  mount point onto itself, changing mount options, such as mount point
  propagation, et cetera.

- overmount higher up the mount path: a mount point has a prefix path of another
  mount path and mount point and thus is hidding the latter, including all mount
  points with paths further down the hierarchy below the hidden mount point.

Lxkns also discovers mount points in mount namespaces that currently are
process-less, but that have been bind-mounted into the VFS ‚Äì one example is the
["snap" technology](https://snapcraft.io/docs) by Canonical.

## üß∞ lxkns Tools

But `lxkns` is more than "just" a Golang package. It also features...

- **lxkns discovery service** exposing namespace discovery information via a
  simple REST API. Of course, our service is build with, guess, `lxkns`.
- **web app** for browsing discovered Linux namespaces in Linux hosts.
- **CLI tools** also build on top of `lxkns` (we _do_ eat our own dog food).

### üêã lxkns REST Service

To give the containerized lxkns discovery service a test drive (needs Docker
with docker-compose to be installed) you can play around with our "Linux
namespaces" react app:

1. `make deploy`,
2. and then navigate to [http://localhost:5010](http://localhost:5010). The
   lxkns web app should load automatically and then display the discovery
   results. The app bar controls show tooltips when hovering over them.
   - `‚ò∞` opens the drawer, where you can navigate to different namespace views.
     In particular, an "all" namespaces view along the user namespace hierarchy,
     as well as per-type views which focus on a specific type of namespace each,
     with the attached processes, organized by their cgroup hierarchy.
   - `>` collapses all namespace nodes, except for top-level nodes (initial user
     and PID namespaces, all other namespaces).
   - `v` expands all namespace nodes.
   - `‚ü≥` manuals refresh -- whenevery you want; displays a progress indicator in
     case of slow refreshes.
   - `üîÑ` opens a pop-up menu to change the refresh interval or switch off
     automatic refresh. Your refresh setting will be stored in your browser's
     local storage.

#### Obligatory Eye Candy

The lxkns web app offers several different views onto the Linux kernel namespaces. To navigate between them, click on the "hamburger" icon to open the drawer or swipe from the left on touch-enabled devices.

![lxkns app navigation](docs/lxkns-app-drawer.png)

See all network namespaces with the "leader" processes attached to them. Please
note the cgroup paths, which help us in identifying Docker containers.

![lxkns app network namespaces](docs/lxkns-app-netns.png)

There's a neat feature in the lxkns app: if we look more closely at the PID
namespaces we notice that one of our Docker containers (the one with the lxkns
service) doesn't use its own PID namespace, but instead is attached to the
initial PID namespace.

![lxkns app PID namespaces](docs/lxkns-app-pidns.png)

Besides the namespace-type specific views, there's the all-in-one view, which is
organized along the hierarchy of user namespaces. The rationale here is that in
the Linux kernel architecture, user namespaces own all other namespaces.

#### lxkns Service Container Deployment

Some deployment notes about the lxkns service container:

- **read-only:** the lxkns service can be used on a read-only container filesystem.
- **non-root:** the holy grail of container hardening ‚Ä¶ wait till you get to
  see our capabilities üòè
- **unprivileged:** because that doesn't mean in-capable üòà
- **capabilities:** not much to see here, just‚Ä¶
  - `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` gives us access to the namespace information in the proc
    filesystem.
  - `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` allow us to switch (especially mount)
    namespaces in order to look into more places compared to standard discovery
    tools. Additionally, they allow us to switch the discovery service back into
    the initial cgroup namespace in order to discover correct cgroup hierarchy
    information. Similar, temporarily switching into the initial mount namespace
    allows us to correctly pick up the freezer ("fridge") states of processes,
    this works around having to either explicitly mount the host's cgroup into
    the container or to unprotect the container's system paths (which
    docker-compose yet does not support).
  - `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` allows us to discover bind-mounted namespaces without
    interference by the indescretionary excess control.

The convertainerized service correctly handles these pitfalls:

- **reading from other mount namespaces**: in order to discover mount points
  from a process-less bind-mounted mount namespace, lxkns forks itself and then
  re-executes the child in the mount namespace to read its procfs `mountinfo`
  from. The child here acts as the required procfs entry to be able to read the
  correct `mountinfo` at all. However, when containerized, lxkns runs in its own
  mount namespace, whereas the bindmount of the mount namespace will be in some
  other mount namespace, such as the host's initial mount namespace. In order to
  successfully reference the bindmount in the VFS, lxkns uses the Linux kernel's
  procfs wormholes: `/proc/[PID]/root/...`, see also
  [proc(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html).

- **cgroup namespaced container**: during startup, lxkns detects when it has
  been placed into its own cgroup namespace ... as, for example, it is the case
  in newer Docker default installations on Linux base OS configurations
  especially with a cgroups v2 unified hierarchy. Without further measures, lxkns would be unable to discover the correct freezer states of processes. Thus, lxkns then switches itself out of its own cgroup namespace and back into the host's initial namespace, if possible. Please note that running lxkns in a non-initial namespace blocks correct discovery, not least process freezer state discovery.

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Tools

To build and install all CLI tools:
- *system install:* simply run `make install` to install the tools into your
   system, defaults to `/usr/local/bin`.
- *local install:* `go install ./cmd/... ./examples/lsallns` installs only
   into `$GOPATH/bin`.

The tools:

- `lsuns`
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns/cmd/lsuns):
  shows _all_ user namespaces in your Linux host, in a neat hierarchy.
  Moreover, it can also show the non-user namespaces "owned" by user
  namespaces. This ownership information is important with respect to
  capabilities and processes switching namespaces using `setns()` ([man 2
  setns](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html)).

- `lspidns`
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns/cmd/lspidns):
  shows _all_ PID namespaces in your Linux host, in a neat hierarchy.
  Optionally, the owning user namespaces can be shown interleaved with the PID
  namespace hierarchy.

- `pidtree`
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns/cmd/pidtree):
  shows either the process hierarchy within the PID namespace hierarchy or a
  single branch only.

- `nscaps`
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns/cmd/nscaps):
  determines a process' capabilities in a namespace, and then displays the
  owning user namespace hierarchy (or hierarchies) of the process and target
  namespace, together with the current process and namespace capabilities.

- `dumpns`
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/thediveo/lxkns/cmd/dumpns):
  runs a namespace (and process) discovery and then dumps the results as JSON.

### lsuns

In its simplest form, `lsuns` shows the hierarchy of user namespaces.

```text
$ sudo lsuns
user:[4026531837] process "systemd" (1) created by UID 0 ("root")
‚îú‚îÄ user:[4026532454] process "unshare" (98171) controlled by "user.slice" created by UID 1000 ("harald")
‚îî‚îÄ user:[4026532517] process "upowerd" (96159) controlled by "system.slice/upower.service" created by UID 0 ("root")
```

> **Note:** `lsuns` does not only show the user namespaces with their IDs and
> hierarchy. It also shows the "most senior" process attached to the particular
> user namespace, as well as the user "owning" the user namespace. The "most
> senior" process is the top-most process in the process tree still attached to
> a (user) namespace; in case of multiple top-most processes ‚Äì such as init(1)
> and kthreadd(2) ‚Äì the older process will be choosen (or the one if the lowest
> PID as in case of the same-age init and kthreadd).

The control group name ("controlled by ...") is the name of the v1 "cpu" control
sub-group controlling a particular most senior process. This name is relative to
the root of the control group filesystem (such as `/sys/fs/cgroup`). The root is
left out in order to reduce clutter.

#### Showing Owned (Non-User) Namespaces

It gets more interesting with the `-d` (details) flag: `lsuns` then additionally
displays all non-user namespaces owned by the user namespaces. In Linux-kernel
namespace parlance, "owning" refers to the relationship between a newly created
namespace and the user namespace that was active at the time the new namespace
was created. For convenience, `lsuns` sorts the owned namespaces first
alphabetically by type, and second numerically by namespace IDs.

### lspidns

On its surface, `lspidns` might appear to be `lsuns` twin, but now for PID namespaces.

#### User-PID Hierarchy

But hidden beneath the surface lies the `-u` flag; "u" as in user namespace. Now
what have user namespaces to do with PID namespaces? Like other non-user
namespaces, also PID namespaces are *owned* by user namespaces. `-u` now tells
`lspidns` to show a "synthesized" hierarchy where owning user namespaces and
owned PID namespaces are laid out in a single tree.

```text
user:[4026531837] process "systemd" (1) created by UID 0 ("root")
‚îî‚îÄ pid:[4026531836] process "systemd" (1)

```

### pidtree

`pidtree` shows either the process hierarchy within the PID namespace
hierarchy or a single branch only. It additionally shows translated PIDs,
which are valid only inside the PID namespace processes are joined to. Such as
in `"containerd" (24446=78)`, where the PID namespace-local PID is 78, but
inside the initial (root) PID namespace the PID is 24446 instead.

```text
$ sudo pidtree

Alternatively, it can show just a single branch down to a PID inside a
specific PID namespace.

### nscaps

`nscaps` calculates a process capabilities in another namespace, based on the
owning user namespace hierarchy. It then displays both the process' and target
namespace user namespace hierarchy for better visual reference how process and
target namespace relate to each other.

Examples like the one below will give unsuspecting security "experts" a series
of fits -- despite this example being perfectly secure.

```text
‚õõ user:[4026531837] process "systemd" (129419)
‚îú‚îÄ process "nscaps" (210373)
‚îÇ     ‚ãÑ‚îÄ (no capabilities)
‚îî‚îÄ ‚úì user:[4026532342] process "unshare" (176744)
   ‚îî‚îÄ target net:[4026532353] process "unshare" (176744)
         ‚ãÑ‚îÄ cap_audit_control    cap_audit_read       cap_audit_write      cap_block_suspend
         ‚ãÑ‚îÄ cap_chown            cap_dac_override     cap_dac_read_search  cap_fowner
         [...]
         ‚ãÑ‚îÄ cap_syslog           cap_wake_alarm
```

...it's secure, because our superpower process can't do anything outside its
realm. But the horror on the faces of security experts will be priceless.

### dumpns

The lxkns namespace discovery information can also be easily made available to
your own scripts, et cetera. Without having to integrate the Go package, simply
run the `dumpns` CLI binary: it dumps fresh discovery results as JSON.

```text
$ dumpns
{
  "namespaces": {
    "4026531840": {
      "nsid": 4026531840,
      "type": "mnt",
      "owner": 4026531837,
      "reference": "/proc/2849/ns/mnt",
      "leaders": [
        2849,
        2770,
        2662,
        2847
      ]
    },
    "4026531835": {
      "nsid": 4026531835,
      "type": "cgroup",
      "owner": 4026531837,
      "reference": "/proc/2849/ns/cgroup",
      "leaders": [
        2849,
...
```

## Package Usage

For the really gory stuff, take a look at the `examples/` and `cmd/`
directories. üòá

### üîé Discovery

The following example code runs a full namespace discovery using
`Discover(FullDiscovery)` and then prints all namespaces found, sorted by
their type, then by their ID.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/thediveo/gons/reexec"
    "github.com/thediveo/lxkns"
    "github.com/thediveo/lxkns/model"
)

func main() {
    reexec.CheckAction() // must be called before a full discovery
    result := lxkns.Discover(lxkns.FullDiscovery)
    for nsidx := model.MountNS; nsidx < model.NamespaceTypesCount; nsidx++ {
        for _, ns := range result.SortedNamespaces(nsidx) {
            fmt.Println(ns.String())
        }
    }
}
```

### üì° Marshalling and Unmarshalling

`lxkns` supports un/marshalling discovery results from/to JSON, this handles
both the namespaces and process information.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/thediveo/gons/reexec"
    "github.com/thediveo/lxkns"
    apitypes "github.com/thediveo/lxkns/api/types"
)

func main() {
    reexec.CheckAction() // only for discovery, not for unmarshalling
    b, _ := json.Marshal(apitypes.NewDiscoveryResult(lxkns.Discover(lxkns.FullDiscovery)))

    dr := apitypes.NewDiscoveryResult(nil)
    _ = json.Unmarshal(b, &dr)
    result := (*lxkns.DiscoveryResult)(dr)
}
```

> **Note:** discovery results need to be "wrapped" in order to be
> un/marshal-able.

## üîß Tinkering

### `make` Targets

- `test`: builds and runs all tests inside a container; the tests are run twice,
  once as root and once as a non-root user.

- `deploy` and `undeploy`: builds and starts, or stops, the containerized lxkns
  discovery service.

- `coverage`: runs a full coverage on all tests in the module, once as root,
  once as non-root, resulting in a single `coverage.html`.

- `clean`: removes coverage files, as well as any top-level CLI tool binaries
  that happened to end up there instead of `${GOPATH}/bin`.

- `install`: builds and installs the binaries into `${GOPATH}/bin`, then
  installs these binaries into `/usr/local/bin`.

### Automated Test Notes

- all lxkns library tests (including the CLI tools) can be run in a test
  container, see the `deployments/test` directory for how the test container is
  built.

- we finally got rid of `--privileged` even for the test container. The last
  missing piece in the puzzle was `--security-opt systempaths=unconfined` in
  order to successfully pass tests in child PID namespaces (and even inside
  child user namespaces to get a better kick out of it) which require remounting
  `/proc`. See also the [Docker Engine 19.03 release
  notes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/19.03/), and [PR #1808:
  add cli integration for unconfined
  systempaths](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1808).

- It's funny to see how people get happy when `--privileged` gets dropped, yet
  `CRAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` doesn't ring a bell ‚Äì when they should
  ring for kingdom come.
