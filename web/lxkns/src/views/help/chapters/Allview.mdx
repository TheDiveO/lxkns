# All View

This "home" display shows all discovered [namespaces](/help/namespaces),
organized along the hierarchy of the so-called user namespaces. For example:

<Example>
  <UserNamespaceTree discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

### Initial Namespaces

As the Linux kernel initializes, it creates a set of so-called "initial"
namespaces: these are indicated by dashed borders around their namespace
"badges". For instance:

<Example maxWidth="16em">
  <NamespaceExample type="user" initial={true} />
</Example>

### Number of Child User

When user namespaces have child user namespaces, then the total number of child
and grandchild user namespaces is shown right after a user namespace "badge".

### "Leader" Processes

Often, multiple (well, _many_) processes are "attached" to (using) the same
namespace. Instead of showing the complete mess, lxkns partitions the attached
processes into groups and shows only the "leader process" for each group.
Grouping is done based on the process tree: a leader process is the topmost
process in the process tree still attached to the same namespace as its
children.

If processes attached to the same namespace are controlled by different CPU
cgroups (using different cpu cgroup paths), then lxkns divides them into
separate groups, based on the cgroup paths found.

Additionally, the "freezer" cgroup state is also shown: a <Pause
className="icon"/> paused process is said to be "frozen" in Linux, while a
&#32;<PlayArrow className="icon"/> running process is also said to be "thawed".

### Owned Namespaces

Non-user namespaces as well as child user namespaces are shown indented and
beneath the particular user namespace which is owning them. "Owning a namespace"
here means that a namespace was created by a process while the process was
attached to that specific user namespace.

### "Shared" Namespaces

When the namespaces owned by a user namespace are attached to processes other
than the most senior "leader" process of the user namespace, then lxkns will
automatically be group owned namespaces by their leader processes. This helps in
quickly understanding how namespaces relate to leader processes.

> **Note:** lxkns always shows all namespaces (except for the user namespace)
  for the leader processes with different cgroup paths, but "fades" namespaces
  that are the same as the most senior leader process. For lack of a better
  word, we term such namespaces "shared", but this is our user-land terminology,
  but not Linux-kernel terminology.
