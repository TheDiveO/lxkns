# Settings

## Appearance

Switch the UI theme between:

- light theme,

- dark theme,

- either light or dark theme based on user preference â€“ only some web browsers
  support this feature, depending on desktop integration.

## Display

Show or hide **system processes**, where system processes are processes
belonging to one of the following cgroups (control groups):

- `/system.slice/*`
- `/init.scope/*`
- `/user.slice`

Defaults to hiding system processes in order to reduce the amount of process
information.
