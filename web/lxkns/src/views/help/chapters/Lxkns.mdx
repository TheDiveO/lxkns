# lxkns

This app displays Linux-kernel
[namespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html) discovered
by the lxkns service in a Linux host.

Namespaces partition certain kinds of Linux resources, so that processes that
are members of a namespace only see their own isolated resources from those
namespaces they are attached to. In a weird twist of penguin logic, "namespaces"
do not have names. Historically, the first type of namespace in Linux was the
"mount" namespace and thus is also about file system paths ... and this is where
the meaning of "namespace" actually originates from.
