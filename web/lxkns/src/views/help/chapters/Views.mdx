# Views

## Home View

The "home" display is organized along the hierarchy of [user
namespaces](/help/namespaces) and shows *all* namespaces.

Non-user namespaces as well as child user namespaces are shown beneath the
particular user namespace which is owning them. "Owning a namespace" here means
that a namespace was created by a process while the process was attached to that
specific user namespace.

## Type-Specific Views

The type-specific namespace views are slightly different: first, they show only
namespaces of a specific type. Then, they are mostly *flat* views, except for
PID and user namespace views.

In case there are multiple bunches of processes, each bunch with its own cgroup
controller, these are then shown below the namespaces they are joined to. In
case all processes joined to a specific namespace are in the same cgroup, the
"most senior" process of them will be shown right next to the namespace
information instead.
