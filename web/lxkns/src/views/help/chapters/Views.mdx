# Views

## Home View

The "home" display shows all discovered [namespaces](/help/namespaces),
organized along the hierarchy of the so-called user namespaces.

<Example>
  <UserNamespaceTree discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

When user namespaces have child user namespaces, then the total number of child
and grandchild user namespaces is shown right after a user namespace "badge".

Non-user namespaces as well as child user namespaces are shown beneath the
particular user namespace which is owning them. "Owning a namespace" here means
that a namespace was created by a process while the process was attached to that
specific user namespace.

When the namespaces owned by a user namespace are attached to processes other
than the most senior "leader" process of the user namespace, then lxkns will
automatically be group owned namespaces by their leader processes. This helps in
quickly understanding how namespaces relate to leader processes.

> **Note:** lxkns shows a "shared" namespace only for the most senior leader
  process in the process tree. A "shared" namespace can nevertheless have
  processes from several leader sub-trees attached to them.

When the Linux kernel initializes, it creates a set of so-called "initial"
namespaces: these are indicated by dashed borders around their namespace
"badges".

## Type-Specific Views

The type-specific namespace views are slightly different: first, they show only
namespaces of a specific type. Then, they are mostly _flat_ views, except for
PID and user namespace views. For instance, these are views of only _user_ or
_mount_ namespaces, respectively:

<Example>
  <NamespaceProcessTree type="user" discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

<Example>
  <NamespaceProcessTree type="mnt" discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

In case the processes attached to a namespace belong to different cgroup
controllers, then additionally all the topmost processes in the process tree
with differing cgroup paths are shown. This is especially usefull in such cases,
where containers share namespaces (either with other containers or the host).
Such as in case of our "lxkns" service container that needs its processes to run
attached to the host's initial PID namespace for correct namespace discovery:

<Example>
  <NamespaceProcessTree type="pid" discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>
