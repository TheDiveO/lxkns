/*

Package log allows consumers of the lxkns module to forward logging originating
in the lxkns module to whatever logger module they prefer.

The accompanying package github.com/thediveo/log/logrus can be used as a simple
means to forward all lxkns-originating logging messages to the standard logrus
logger instance. YMMV, however.
